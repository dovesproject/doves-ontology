Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System,PROMIS,"Overseen by the National Institute of Health (NIH), PROMIS includes a  suite of item banks relevant across a range of common medical conditions. It therefore includes both generic, and symptom and disease-specific, PROM item banks. Item selection relies on item-response theory, where new items are selected based on previous responses by participants (i.e., computer adaptive testing). This enables a more tailored experience for a patient and a more clear picture of their outcomes. Item banks are available for adults,  children and parent proxies. They cover an extensive range of conditions, symptoms and symptom areas broadly grouped under mental health, physical health and social health. For example, there are different item banks for physical function, itch, sleep disturbance and dyspnea, all under adult physical health. Item banks in PROMIS have been derived through selection and refinement of existing well-validated PROMs. The PROMIS-29 one of the most widely-used of the tools; it is a generic PROM that assesses depression, anxiety, physical function, pain interference, fatigue, sleep disturbance, and participation in social roles and activities.
